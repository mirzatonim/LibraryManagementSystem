This is a basic Library Management System based on Python, where admins can register themselves. 
Once an admin logs in, he/she can perform basic CRUD operations like adding members, deleting members, updating members, and showing all member lists.
Moreover, admins have one more facility: book management, where they can add books, delete books, update book information, and show a list of all books.
Besides, once an admin adds a member, the member can log into the system with credentials provided by the admin.
Users can only some limited features which are searching books, seeing all the books available, borrowing books(max limit is 3), and returning books.
